    "title": "Fundamentals of Probability: A First Course",
    "author": "Anirban DasGupta",
    "description": "Probability theory is one branch of mathematics that is simultaneously deep and immediately applicable in diverse areas of human endeavor. It is as fundamental as calculus. Calculus explains the external world, and probability theory helps predict a lot of it. In addition, problems in probability theory have an innate appeal, and the answers are often structured and strikingly beautiful. A solid background in probability theory and probability models will become increasingly more useful in the twenty-?rst century, as dif?cult new problems emerge, that will require more sophisticated models and analysis. Thisisa text onthe fundamentalsof thetheoryofprobabilityat anundergraduate or ?rst-year graduate level for students in science, engineering,and economics. The only mathematical background required is knowledge of univariate and multiva- ate calculus and basic linear algebra. The book covers all of the standard topics in basic probability, such as combinatorial probability, discrete and continuous distributions, moment generating functions, fundamental probability inequalities, the central limit theorem, and joint and conditional distributions of discrete and continuous random variables. But it also has some unique features and a forwa- looking feel.",

    "author": "Susanne A. Quallich; Michelle J. Lajiness",
    "description": "This new edition updates the previous one and adds additional content related to postoperative management, pain management, LGBTQ care, and uroradiology. This book is designed to meet the needs of nurse practitioners, advanced practice nurses globally and physician assistants working in urology. Content assumes some background knowledge regarding the normal anatomy and physiology of the genitourinary system and the pathophysiology underlying specific urologic health-related problems. This ensures that the provider can pursue exemplary management of patients with acute and chronic urologic conditions in a wide variety of settings, including independent practices, and academic urologic practices. This manual fills the gaps that traditional curricula may have left, permitting the reader to proceed with confident management of adult patients with urologic care needs, promoting the role of a skilled clinician in urology, especially for chronic, non-operative urologic conditions while recognizing those conditions which may benefit from surgical management.As the burden of urologic disease increases with an aging U.S. population, it is increasingly clear that nurse practitioners and physician assistants will be called on to move into roles caring for patients with urologic disease. Use of NPs and PAs to their highest education will become an increasingly important strategy for maintaining access and reducing costs, in the context of urologist workforce that is shrinking. However, urology topics receive sporadic attention in NP and PA curricula, leaving practicing NPs and PAs with gaps in their knowledge concerning trends and recommendations for management of urologic health conditions. As this demand for provider visits for urologic concerns increases, the demand for provider services to care for patients with urologic health concerns will also increase, and presents the opportunity for both NPs and PAs to move into specialty practice environments within urology.",

I thought that a person might find it easier to read a poem with some specific meaning for a day's diet routine rather than a lengthy article. Hence my idea of a poetry book about a weight loss theme. I also wanted to offer this book as a keepsake of a job well done so a person, can record their thoughts and meal plans for each day's effort in the weight loss struggle.",

Praise for Book 1 in the series \"An inspiring read for any child who loves the natural world.\"--ROSANNE PARRY, NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF A WOLF CALLED WANDER Raised by his adoptive father, Wolf 21 has become one of Yellowstone's most famous wolves. As leader of the Druid pack, he's known for his bravery, his kindness, and his commitment to his mate--the equally impressive Wolf 42. Together, they are a couple the likes of which the park has never seen. Then there's Wolf 302: a flirt who avoids fights, naps during conflicts, and begs for food instead of hunting. When the trouble-making rebel starts hanging around the Druids, 21 and 42 try to drive him away, but 302 keeps coming back, and, little by little, begins to grow out of his immature ways. But is it enough? Does 302 have what it takes to become an alpha like the greats who came before him? Drawing on Rick McIntyre's work with the wolves of Yellowstone and told in an engaging style that brilliantly captures the real-life drama of the wolves' lives, A Time of Legends is a powerful story of redemption and transformation. Book 2 in The Chronicles of the Yellowstone Wolves series! In The Chronicles of the Yellowstone Wolves series, renowned wolf expert Rick McIntyre and award-winning author David A. Poulsen team up to bring the fascinating stories of the Yellowstone wolves to a new generation of readers. Based on McIntyre's award-winning, bestselling books for adult readers, and containing a wealth of scientifically sound information on wolf behavior, this series is written in an engaging style that brings the drama and intrigue of the wolves' world to life.",

    "description": "Joseph Schumpeter is seen as the foremost theoretician of entrepreneurship. In addition, Schumpeter, whose \"creative destruction\" is as famous as Milton Friedman's \"there is no free lunch,\" is increasingly recognized as a major economist, often given the same stature as John Maynard Keynes. Schumpeter spent the last twenty years of his life as a Professor of Economics at Harvard University. English-speaking readers may be familiar with some of his works, especially The Theory of Economic Development and the classic Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy. However, very few of Schumpeter's key texts on the entrepreneur and entrepreneurship have been available in English. This anthology contains several newly translated texts and puts together, for the very first time, all of Schumpeter's writings on the entrepreneur and entrepreneurship. English-speaking readers will now be able to access the entire palette of Schumpeter's work and to follow the evolution of his ideas over time. The volume begins with an introduction that points readers to the most important aspects of the works presented. The introduction also attempts to go beyond Schumpeter's ideas, drawing on his basic intuitions of entrepreneurship to share a couple of key notions: that entrepreneurship consists of a new combination of already existing elements in the economy and that the entrepreneur has to break through resistance to the new idea, in him or herself as well as in others.",

Benning, Georgia, as an Army aviator before he was assigned to Vietnam in 1965. He served with the 197th Armed Helicopter Company and took over as a platoon commander. He told about his combat experiences, the various missions in which he participated, and the strategies employed. John A. Duff was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and he felt that his religion protected him even though he was shot at every day. Because he did not drink alcohol, many of the other soldiers trusted him more than those who did. He lost many of his friends in combat, came close to losing his life many times, and was shot down four times. He thought that the war was not justified and that the U.S. should have decided if it was fighting to win or to lose the war.",

As roads and water and sewer lines are one type of infrastructure, a diverse mix of dwelling types is another kind of infrastructure - the infrastructure in which we live. This thesis looks at the way the homeless have sheltered themselves in the past, and comes to several conclusions about how they might be sheltered in the future such that homelessness becomes a natural part of the urban landscape. Through this process of changing societal attitudes through the design of physical space, homelessness loses its label of \"problem\" and becomes more accepted as a way of life.",

    "author": "SHANA. GRANDERSON A. LADY",
    "description": "Fate places both the Darcy and Bennet parents at the Bell Inn in Stilton on the 5th day of March 1790. Both ladies are pregnant, and both have gone into premature labour. Thomas Bennet and Robert Darcy meet while their wives are labouring. As the two become acquainted, bonding over their shared love of the written word among other things, Darcy shares that his wife has had multiple miscarriages and stillbirths and his belief that if it is another stillbirth his beloved Lady Anne will not survive. Bennet shares that his eldest daughter, Jane, is home being looked after by his mother and his worry as his wife was much larger than she had been when she carried his daughter coupled with her labours beginning early. Robert Darcy passes out from over imbibing brandy and to relax and relieve his tension, Mr. Bennet takes a walk outside. When Bennet returns, the midwife tells him that both ladies have given birth. His Fanny, who he is deeply in love with, has birthed twins, but the second one was stillborn. The other lady, he is told, birthed a healthy daughter. The Bennets depart two days later to take Elizabeth Rose home and to bury their second daughter, who they named Lydia. The second twin was of fair complexion and blond while Lizzy darker, and dark curly hair like her Grandmother Beth. Like her grandmother and namesake, Lizzy has a distinctive birthmark on her left hand. It is obvious from the story that the daughter the Darcys return to Pemberley with is in fact the Bennet's second twin. She is named Beth-Anne and as the 'miracle babe' who saved her mother from depression or worse, she is very much indulged and not often corrected. One of the questions the story answers is who separated the twins? Was it Thomas Bennet in an act of compassion, the midwife, or was it Robert Darcy to save his wife from the heartbreak of another stillborn child? Of course, at some point the twins will meet. The question is how is the truth uncovered and how will each of the sisters react, especially as they are identical twins. Many of the characters we know are present along with some not in canon.",

    "description": "The Italian sculptor known as Donatello helped to forge a new kind of art—one that came to define the Renaissance. His work was progressive, challenging, and even controversial. Using a variety of novel sculptural techniques and innovative interpretations, Donatello uniquely depicted themes involving human sexuality, violence, spirituality, and beauty. But to really understand Donatello, one needs to understand his changing world, marked by the transition from Medieval to Renaissance style and to an art that was more personal and representative of the modern self. Donatello was not just a man of his times, he helped shape the spirit of the times he lived in and profoundly influenced those that came after. In this beautifully illustrated book—the first thorough biography of Donatello in twenty-five years—A. Victor Coonin describes the full extent of Donatello’s revolutionary contributions, revealing how his work heralded the emergence of modern art.",

Considering increasing evidence of pernicious environmental and social effects resulting from industrialized practices, substantial strides have been made to develop alternative methods, but structural and cultural obstacles impede their widespread adoption. By placing late 19th and early 20th century agricultural publications within the context of agroecology, it is possible to weave a thread through history that reconnects with the previous path of development. This connection can help build a foundation for sustainable transition of family farms in the Midwest. By distilling the principles and practices common to pre-industrial and sustainable farming into a guidebook, this project makes them highly accessible. Implementing these principles and practices could mitigate negative environmental impacts of agriculture, revitalize rural communities through the development of vibrant agricultural economies, and contribute to the development of a sustainable and resilient agricultural future in the Midwest.",

    "description": "Issues germane to the provision of guided tours for tourists wishing to visit a particular location during the slack season have received scant theoretical attention in the tourism literature. Therefore, we conduct a stochastic analysis of guided tours for tourists during the slack season. We first delineate a general model that accounts for the common features of guided tours to city attractions and to other scenic locations. Second, we determine the long run fraction of demand that is lost to the firm providing the guided tours. Third, we ascertain the long run fraction of time that the guided tour providing firm is unable to satisfy the demand for such tours. Finally, we use the stationary Poisson process and show how our previous two general results might be used to shed practical light on the slack season provision of guided tours to tourists.",

    "description": "The need for more effective heat exchangers is becoming more necessary these days. At the same time, the size of the heat exchanger also plays a big role. Therefore, in many applications the compact plate heat exchanger is used where high effectiveness and small size are required. As a result, it is necessary to study and understand the performance of compact plate heat exchangers. More specifically, the performance of heat transfer, represent by the Colburn factor j, and friction factor f, must be deeply studied and understood. A mathematical model has been built to express f and j factors based on existing correlations. Also, experimental results have been obtained and compared with the analytical model. It was found that Martin's correlation of finding friction and Colburn factors are not in agreement with the experimental results for a compact heat exchanger. Therefore, the findings show that compactness has an effect on performance, and that the j and f factors should be modified in the future to reflect this.",

    "description": "My Darlings is a memoir of the rollicking life and times of the grande dame of Oakland, Florida--from growing up in the frontier town of Denver, to studying voice in the big city of Chicago, to pioneering in the backwoods of central Florida. Grace was born in 1884 in Denver and moved to Chicago around the turn of the century to study voice in hopes of becoming an opera singer. Instead, she married the delightful Charles Frederic Mather-Smith, twenty years her senior, and the newlyweds made their winter home in rural Oakland, Florida, when central Florida was still a primeval jungle teeming with wild animals and exotic flora just beginning to be tamed by homesteading farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. As Grace says, it was the hand of Destiny that led her new husband and her to Oakland, where Grace raised her family, shook up the community, and lived for more than fifty happy years. As recounted in her memoir, Grace was a devoted wife and mother, a pioneer, a community organizer, an opera singer, a midwife, a businesswoman, a philanthropist--and a great beauty whom men found irresistible. Grace was the first woman in Florida to drive a car; the owner of the first telephone and phonograph in Oakland, and of the first bathtub and flushing toilet in central Florida; and the first person to drive a car to the top of Pike's Peak without a mechanic. Grace's voice comes across loud and clear in her memoir, which is illustrated with more than 20 family photos. She was flamboyant, theatrical, uninhibited, adventurous, energetic, glamorous, exuberant, unconventional, willful, irrepressible, big-hearted, and generous to a fault. Her memoir quotes family and friends who describe Grace as being \"like a thoroughbred horse ... always out there in the limelight,\" \"born for the concert stage and the opera,\" and \"prone to gallivantin' around.\" She was larger than life--a force of nature--and has been likened to Auntie Mame. As Eve Bacon wrote in her book Oakland: The Early Years, Grace \"hit staid little Oakland\" like \"a social bombshell.\"",

Post-Cold War downsizing and widespread budget cuts have occurred side by side with intensive deployment and operational-tempo demands-conditions that have translated into a growing reliance on the Reserve Components (RC). The reserves now play a far more substantial role in military contingencies, including peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, and the military's reliance on the reserves is only expected to grow. The QDR's new vision thus raises many questions about the most appropriate balance of capabilities between active and reserve forces and about the possible need for changes in how the Reserve Components are used. All told, the QDR notes that, as the military's transformation takes shape, DoD will continue to rely on reserve forces to help in new restructuring and reorganization opportunities. In particular, the QDR (2001, p. 23) mandated a \"comprehensive review of Active and Reserve mix, organization, priority missions, and associated resources.\"",

The essays are designed to overlap in the well-tested & established fields & branches of law dealing with contemporary issues which lawyers, diplomats, political scientists, politicians & research scholars are familiar with. The essays fully demonstrate the depth of knowledge of the eminent professors & specialists who have written them. The two volumes of essays are divided into seven parts. Volume One, entitled Contemporary International Law & Human Rights , focuses essentially on subjects relating to International Law & is divided into three sections. Part one of the first volume encompasses Topics in International Law such as Some New Thoughts on the Codification of International Law by his Excellency Judge Roberto Ago; Evidence in the Procedure of the International Court of Justice: The Role of the Court by His Excellency Judge Manfred Lachs; The Validity of International Law: an Empirical Experiment by Professor Georg Schwarzenberger, with a particularly engaging & incisive Introduction to the two volumes of Essays by Professor Ian Brownlie, Q.C. Human rights subjects still hold pride of place in the thinking of many legal experts & scholars & that is clearly reflected here. The title of the second volume is African Law & Comparative Public Law. Part Five of the essays contains topics of interest in the African Legal system which has its roots in the British Common Law System. Constitutional Law is broadly covered in part six which forms a section of its own in Volume Two.

    "description": "A Pulitzer Prize–winning historian’s \"breathtakingly original\" (Junot Diaz) reinterpretation of the eight decades surrounding the Civil War. \"Capatious [and] buzzing with ideas.\" --The Boston Globe Volume 3 in the Penguin History of the United States, edited by Eric Foner In this ambitious story of American imperial conquest and capitalist development, Pulitzer Prize–winning historian Steven Hahn takes on the conventional histories of the nineteenth century and offers a perspective that promises to be as enduring as it is controversial. It begins and ends in Mexico and, throughout, is internationalist in orientation. It challenges the political narrative of “sectionalism,” emphasizing the national footing of slavery and the struggle between the northeast and Mississippi Valley for continental supremacy. It places the Civil War in the context of many domestic rebellions against state authority, including those of Native Americans. It fully incorporates the trans-Mississippi west, suggesting the importance of the Pacific to the imperial vision of political leaders and of the west as a proving ground for later imperial projects overseas. It reconfigures the history of capitalism, insisting on the centrality of state formation and slave emancipation to its consolidation. And it identifies a sweeping era of “reconstructions” in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that simultaneously laid the foundations for corporate liberalism and social democracy. The era from 1830 to 1910 witnessed massive transformations in how people lived, worked, thought about themselves, and struggled to thrive. It also witnessed the birth of economic and political institutions that still shape our world. From an agricultural society with a weak central government, the United States became an urban and industrial society in which government assumed a greater and greater role in the framing of social and economic life. As the book ends, the United States, now a global economic and political power, encounters massive warfare between imperial powers in Europe and a massive revolution on its southern border―the remarkable Mexican Revolution―which together brought the nineteenth century to a close while marking the important themes of the twentieth.",

    "description": "Excerpt from A History of the Calvinistic Congregational Church and Society; Fitchburg, Massachusetts The zeal for religion and religious Observances which characterized the early years of Puritan times began to wane, and spiritual deadness was rife in the earlier part of the eighteenth century. This was deplored by the ministers and the zealous church members, who prayed earnestly for a revival of religion. Their prayers were answered when, about the year 1735, a great revival, largely due to the preaching and inﬂuence of Jonathan Edwards, spread throughout the state, and many new members were added to the churches and their whole spiritual life quickened. This great religious awakening, however, while it stirred up and strengthened the or thodox churches, had a tendency to draw a stricter line and to make more evident the schism between the two antagonistic theological parties - the Calvinists and the Arminians. Harvard college soon became the cen ter of Arminian or Unitarian views, while Yale college was the stronghold of Calvinism. In the Boston churches there was a strong current of sympathy with liberal religious views, and the Calvinist church mem bers throughout the state found themselves year by year less able to control the voters of the towns.

During the first part of the 1960s, he, along with others, transformed the discipline into a science, spatial science, or as it was also called, the \"new geography.\" After his contribution, human geography was utterly different. How it looked on the page, how it was written, what skills were needed, what counted as good geographical work, and who was deemed a capable geographer were all fundamentally altered. Before Haggett, human geography was defined by the descriptive study of unique regions. Under a given geographical typology (e.g., \"relief,\" \"climate,\" \"major cities,\" and \"transportation systems\"), the facts of a region were painstakingly gathered, collated, and illustrated with maps and black-and-white photos. ...",

Shows how biological function mediated by membranes is controlled by lipid membrane structure and organization on length scales ranging from the size of the individual molecule, across molecular assemblies of proteins and lipid domains in the range of nanometers, to the size of whole cells. Applications of lipids in nano-technology and biomedicine are also described.",

    "title": "A Balthus Notebook",
    "author": "Guy Davenport",
    "description": "In his 1989 book on Balthus—the storied and controversial artist who worked in Paris throughout the twentieth century—Guy Davenport gives one of the most nuanced, literary, and compelling readings of the work of this master. Reading it today highlights the change in perspectives on sexuality and nudity in art in the past thirty years. Written over several years in his notebooks, Davenport’s distinct reflections on Balthus’s paintings try to explain why his work is so radical, and why it has so often come under scrutiny for its depiction of girls and women. Davenport throws the lens back on the viewer and asks: is it us or Balthus who reads sexuality into these paintings? For Davenport, the answer is clear: Balthus may indeed show us periods in adolescent development that are uncomfortable to view, but the eroticization exists primarily on the part of the viewer. Arguing that Balthus’s figures are erotic only if we make them so, and that their innocence is more present than anything pornographic in them, Davenport posits that the paintings hold up a mirror to our own perversities and force us, difficultly, to confront them. He writes, “The nearer an artist works to the erotic politics of his own culture, the more he gets its concerned attention. Gauguin’s naked Polynesian girls, brown and remote, escape the scandal of Balthus’s, although a Martian observer would not see the distinction.” Davenport’s critique helps us understand Balthus in our times—something we need more than ever as we crucially confront sexual politics in visual art.",

Almost all of us have experienced emotional, physical, and even psychological hurts and wounds from our relationships with parents, siblings, lovers, colleagues, and friends in society. Mary Muinamu is a counseling psychologist, relationship coach, and founder of Relationships Powerlift. Her passion for healthy relationships developed at a very tender age when she noticed that many people were struggling with relationships, especially in marriage. This desire for flourishing relationships drove her into studying Counseling Psychology and writing this book. A responsive spouse is an initial step in dealing with some of these issues. A spouse who is receptive to their spouse's needs is likely to understand them more, minimize conflict, and handle them appropriately. A responsive spouse enlightens and enables you to spot and identify your spouse's various needs and address them accordingly. It also helps to bring healing to hurting marriages. It is an eye-opener for those who are single and those who are married. This book will not leave you the same. It has a wealth of knowledge that many people discover after many years of marriage. I t is not a mystery to come to terms with your spouse's needs and be in a position to meet them. We all understand that we need to meet each other's needs, but we sometimes try to assume this for whatever reasons. However, this is for our good if we want a happy and lasting relationship. Many people argue that people change after marriage. However, this is not the case. Most likely, those who seem to change after union were acting during courtship because they never wanted to lose their spouse. That is why even when you start a relationship, it should be normal to disagree on some things. The nature of man is to put a facade and especially to those he or she wants to deceive with his or her reputation. However, a natural person who is true to himself or herself does not mind what the other person might think of him or her as long as he is true to himself or herself. A real man or woman will love you for who you are and learn to accommodate your weaknesses. I am that kind of a person whereby if I decide I will not do something, I will not do it no matter what. I did not know my husband was interested in me when we were young and single, and this aspect of my character used to come out quite often. 109 A Responsive Spouse When he proposed, I remember I asked him how daring he was to love me with that character. His response to me was, \"I knew you were not acting. I also wanted someone who could challenge me.\"Develop your character and be you. The things you consider off and unpleasing may not be as bad as you think before your lover; let them come out.",

The Pharos at Alexandria survived into the Middle Ages, but the Hanging Gardens of Babylon exist only in references by ancient authors and the Colossus of Rhodes if too improbable to have existed in the form and place traditionally ascribed to it. The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World sets the record straight, with an attractive account of each Wonder in the context in which it was built. The authors combine ancient sources with the results of modern scholarship and excavations to recreate a vivid picture of the Seven Wonders. All experts in their specialist fields, the contributors bring together facts and background that are remarkably difficult to find from any other single source and establish for the fist time the archaeology and location of each Wonder.",

    "description": "The third edition of The Social Studies Curriculum thoroughly updates the definitive overview of the primary issues teachers face when creating learning experiences for students in social studies. By connecting the diverse elements of the social studies curriculum—history education, civic, global, and social issues—the book offers a unique and critical perspective that separates it from other texts in the field. This edition includes new work on race, gender, sexuality, critical multiculturalism, visual culture, moral deliberation, digital technologies, teaching democracy, and the future of social studies education. In an era marked by efforts to standardize curriculum and teaching, this book challenges the status quo by arguing that social studies curriculum and teaching should be about uncovering elements that are taken for granted in our everyday experiences, and making them the target of inquiry.",

This book is a systematic summary of what we have learnt about the geological evolution of Mars as a result of these missions. It describes the diverse Martian surface features and summarizes current ideas as to how, when, and under what conditions they formed, and explores how Earth and Mars differ and why the two planets evolved so differently. The author also discusses possible implications of the geologic history for the origin and survival of indigenous Martian life. Up-to-date and highly illustrated, this book will be a principal reference for researchers and graduate students in planetary science. The comprehensive list of references will also assist readers in pursuing further information on the subject. Colour images can be found at www.cambridge.org/9780521872010.",

    "description": "The operational hazards associated with the use of a plutonium-fueled thermoelectric generator in a terrestrial satellite are evaluated. It appears that the plutonium fuel can be consumed and dispersed at high altitude during reentry, following a successful mission. As an alternative, however, since the fuel (Pu23) is an alpha emitter with a long half life, it appears that random intant recntry following a suceessful mission is feasible. As a precaution against aborted missions, the launch azimuth should be over water as much as possible to avoid impact or dispersion in areas of signifieant population density. It is recommended that the fuel and generators be transported by air carrier to preclude local restrictions of ground transport and to provide better statistical safety. The transport phase poses a very minor safety problem.",

They include recurring operating and support costs, nonrecurring operations and maintenance costs, and investments costs, such as facility construction. The study also examines intermediate factors, such as personnel pay rates, that are used to develop cost estimates.",

    "title": "The Transatlantic Constitution",
    "author": "Mary Sarah Bilder",
    "description": "Departing from traditional approaches to colonial legal history, Mary Sarah Bilder argues that American law and legal culture developed within the framework of an evolving, unwritten transatlantic constitution that lawyers, legislators, and litigants on both sides of the Atlantic understood. The central tenet of this constitution—that colonial laws and customs could not be repugnant to the laws of England but could diverge for local circumstances—shaped the legal development of the colonial world. Focusing on practices rather than doctrines, Bilder describes how the pragmatic and flexible conversation about this constitution shaped colonial law: the development of the legal profession; the place of English law in the colonies; the existence of equity courts and legislative equitable relief; property rights for women and inheritance laws; commercial law and currency reform; and laws governing religious establishment. Using as a case study the corporate colony of Rhode Island, which had the largest number of appeals of any mainland colony to the English Privy Council, she reconstructs a largely unknown world of pre-Constitutional legal culture.",

The introductory stories illustrate courage in three extraordinary women and Deloria's ability to subordinate her voice to that of different narrators. Another tale, \"The Prairie Dogs,\" explains how the warriors' and chiefs' societies, the strongest forces for social cohesion, came into being.\" \"The longest story, \"The Buffalo People,\" concerns the origin of tribal identity based on such ideal qualities as the strength and generosity of the buffalo and the resiliency and grace of the corn. Following the noted storyteller Makula (Breast or Left Heron), Deloria improvises upon the poetic conventions of oral performance, from simple asides to traditional set speeches of the Buffalo Woman ceremony. Blending careful observation with creative skill, these stories offer new and often surprising perspectives on Lakota culture. They will entertain and instruct any reader with an interest in Native American societies of the past and present.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

    "description": "\"In June 2011 the Superintendents of the Gulf of the Farallones (GF) and Cordell Banks (CB) National Marine Sanctuaries (NMS) established a Vessel Spills Working Group (VSWG) to provide an analysis and advisory report on the use of oil dispersants within the GF and CB NMS. The formation of the VSWG was the result of a recommendation in the GFNMS 2008 Management Plan. The objective of the VSWG is to provide a set of recommendations to the Sanctuary Advisory Councils (SAC) to consider and transmit to the Superintendents for their consideration. This process was completed in May 2012 and report presented to the SACs on June 7, 2012. The VSWG had invited technical members who discussed inter-agency coordination and response, dispersant decision protocols, oil spill trajectory models, and response technologies. The VSWG decided to focus more on oil spill response technologies and specifically the use of dispersants. In order to fully understand the complexity and dynamics of the fate of oil and oil dispersants and the potential impacts of dispersed oil on the resources within the Sanctuaries, the VSWG has conducted a series of meetings with presentations from identified regional experts in the areas of toxicology, oceanography and the biological resources of the Sanctuaries. The effect of oil and dispersed oil on human health was not a topic discussed with the VSWG. However, a general discussion on this topic is included at the end of the background section based on a group consensus that the topic merits consideration\"--Executive summary.",

    "description": "“A lively tale of historical innovation, the thrill of the bibliophile’s hunt, greed and betrayal.” – The New York Times Book Review \"An addictive and engaging look at the ‘competitive, catty and slightly angst-ridden’ heart of the world of book collecting.” - The Houston Chronicle The never-before-told story of one extremely rare copy of the Gutenberg Bible, and its impact on the lives of the fanatical few who were lucky enough to own it. For rare-book collectors, an original copy of the Gutenberg Bible--of which there are fewer than 50 in existence--represents the ultimate prize. Here, Margaret Leslie Davis recounts five centuries in the life of one copy, from its creation by Johannes Gutenberg, through the hands of monks, an earl, the Worcestershire sauce king, and a nuclear physicist to its ultimate resting place, in a steel vault in Tokyo. Estelle Doheny, the first woman collector to add the book to her library and its last private owner, tipped the Bible onto a trajectory that forever changed our understanding of the first mechanically printed book. The Lost Gutenberg draws readers into this incredible saga, immersing them in the lust for beauty, prestige, and knowledge that this rarest of books sparked in its owners. Exploring books as objects of obsession across centuries, this is a must-read for history buffs, book collectors, seekers of hidden treasures, and anyone who has ever craved a remarkable book--and its untold stories.",

Bored and disgusted by the vulgarity of everyday life, Durtal seeks spiritual solace by immersing himself in another age. But when he starts asking questions about Gilles's involvement in satanic rituals and is introduced to the exquisitely evil madame Chantelouve, he is soon drawn into a twilight world of black magic and erotic devilry in fin-de- siècle Paris. Published in 1891, The Damned cemented Huysmans's reputation as a writer at the forefront of the avant-garde and as one of the most challenging and innovative figures in European literature.

    "title": "The Peloponnesian War",
    "author": "John Francis Lazenby",
    "description": "The range and extent of the Peloponnesian War of the fifth century BC has led to it being described as a 'world war' in miniature. With the struggle between Athens and Sparta at its core, the twenty-seven-year conflict drew in states from all points of the compass; from Byzantion in the north, Crete in the south, Asia Minor in the east and Sicily in the west. Since Thucydides described the war as 'the greatest disturbance to befall the Greeks' numerous studies have been made of individual episodes and topics. This authoritative work is the first single-volume study of the entire war to be published in over seventy-five years. Lazenby avoids the tendency of allowing historiography to obscure the analysis, and while paying due attention to detail, also looks at the fundamental questions of warfare raised by the conflict. Within a narrative framework, Lazenby concentrates on the fighting itself, and examining the way in which both strategy and tactics developed as the conflict spread. Not afraid to challenge accepted views, he assesses the war as a military rather than a political endeavour, evaluating issues such as the advantages and limitations of sea power. A readable and clear survey, this text offers a balanced discussion of controversial themes, and will appeal to ancient historians, classicists and all those who are interested in military history.",

This is a book for the ages.\" —Rivka Galchen, author of Atmospheric Disturbances The essay form is an especially democratic one, and many of the essays Phillip Lopate has gathered here address themselves—sometimes critically—to American values. We see the Puritans, the Founding Fathers and Mothers, and the stars of the American Renaissance struggle to establish a national culture. A grand tradition of nature writing runs from Audubon, Thoreau, and John Muir to Rachel Carson and Annie Dillard. Marginalized groups use the essay to assert or to complicate notions of identity. Lopate has cast his net wide, embracing critical, personal, political, philosophical, literary, polemical, autobiographical, and humorous essays. Americans by birth as well as immigrants appear here, famous essayists alongside writers more celebrated for fiction or poetry. The result is a dazzling overview of the riches of the American essay.",

    "title": "A blanc check for intervention - the evolution of the Monroe Doctrine and its significance in contemporary U.S. foreign policy",
    "author": "Michael Schmid",
    "description": "Seminar paper from the year 2005 in the subject Politics - Region: USA, grade: 1,3, Indiana University (Political Science Department), course: American Political Traditions, language: English, abstract: The Monroe Doctrine will be 200 years old in 2023 and the world of today could not be more different than from the conditions of the world in which president James Monroe gave his speech, which would become so famous and significant for the direction of U.S. foreign policy. Yet the policies of the Monroe Doctrine are still very much alive. Especially after president Theodore Roosevelt announced the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine in 1904 America’s path of becoming a major player in world affairs with arbitrary power was paved for them. The argument of this paper is that the document known today as the Monroe Doctrine started out as a simple but efficient and bold proclamation, which dealt with the problems of its time and has been transformed into a tool for global involvement. Originally it attempts to keep Europeans out of the New World but it does not attack the already existing colonies in the Western Hemisphere. Over time various presidents altered this original phrasing. One of the more important examples of this tradition is Theodore Roosevelt’s Corollary to the doctrine, which will serve as an illustration to outline the main argument. Roosevelt turned the meaning of the doctrine around and went from noninterference to active responsibility by the United States to intervene anywhere in the Western Hemisphere where chaos and violence ruled. Still limited on the Western Hemisphere and whatever was defined to fit into this category Roosevelt’s definition of the “international police power” soon became just that. The United States would enter two World Wars on the basic justification that they were restoring order and justice and were only acting out of self-defense reasons. After World War II nothing of what James Monroe had once proclaimed as essential to American progress was left. The defining characteristic of Monroe’s old doctrine-the non-interference with European affairs phrase-had been shattered to pieces. The Cold War forced the United States to become even more dedicated to European matters and even after the Cold War the U.S. or a multilateral coalition under U.S. leadership now dealt with new threats to European peace. With the post 9/11 era all dreams about isolation from Europe were forever destroyed. The War on Terrorism is the latest effort of the United States to change the conditions of countries all around the world.",

His writing is clear and organized, the chapters can be very short, his argumentation is persuasive and can seem disconnected at times until the connection is found; we enter the brain of a great systems thinker ...; Michel Odent's scientifically evidenced linkages between seemingly disconnected events grows our understanding of interconnectedness; a key quality for the survival of humanity.'Midwifery TodayAt a global scale, love hormones are now redundant in the critical period surrounding birth ... reasons for questions?Between 1970 and 1990, in many parts of the world, the rates of caesareans escalated from roughly 5% to roughly 25%. During this short phase of history, the father's participation became routine. Is there a link between these facts?Health care systems are on the way to collapsing. Should we go on focusing on the preventive and curative treatments of particular diseases or should we give a greater importance to the way our basic adaptive systems, involved in what we commonly call health, reach a high degree of maturity?These examples are sufficient to illustrate the 'neo-Socratic attitude' of the author. Our contemporaries are constantly dealing with unprecedented situations. Question marks, therefore, can symbolise the current phase of our history. Throughout this book, radically new situations are analysed, before appropriate questions are phrased.At a time when people commonly debate on the long-term effects of human activities without considering the probable transformations of Homo, one cannot avoid a preliminary question: How to reach an audience made up of female and male open-minded people who are turned towards the future but have not yet realised that the important period surrounding birth has been radically transformed during the past decades?In the age of cultural blindness related to overspecialization, The Future of Homo is also a training tool to think across boundaries.Related Link(s)",

Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1905 edition. Excerpt: ...folk, the stark hunters and tree-fellers, and the war-worn regulars who fought beside them in the forest, pushed ever westward the frontier of the Republic. Year after year each group of rough settlers and rough soldiers wrought its part in the great epic of wilderness conquest. The people that for one or more generations finds its allotted task in the conquest of a continent, has before it the possibility of splendid victory, and the certainty of incredible toil, suffering, and hardship. The opportunity is great indeed; but the chance of disaster is even greater. Success is for a mighty race, in its vigorous and masterful prime. It is an opportunity such as is offered to an army by a struggle against a powerful foe; only by great effort can defeat be avoided, but triumph means lasting honor and renown. As it is in the battle, so it is in the infinitely greater contests where the fields of fight are continents, and the ages form the measure of time. In actual life the victors win in spite of brutal blunders and repeated checks. Watched nearby, while the fight stamps to and fro, the doers and the deeds stand out naked and ugly. We see all too clearly the blood and sweat, the craft and cunning and blind luck, the raw cruelty and stupidity, the shortcomings of heart and hand, the mad abuse of victory. Strands of meanness and cowardice are everywhere shot through the warp of lofty and generous daring. There are failures bitter and shameful side by side with feats of triumphant prowess. Of those who venture in the contest some achieve success; others strive feebly and fail ignobly. If a race is weak, if it is lacking in the physical and moral traits which go to the makeup of a conquering people, it cannot succeed. For three hundred years the...",

    "title": "The Frankenstein Film Sourcebook",
    "author": "Caroline Picart; Frank Smoot; Jayne Blodgett",
    "description": "The endurance of the Frankenstein narrative as a modern cinematic myth is undeniable. Its flexibility has produced classic and contemporary horror film-most notably the Universal films of the thirties-but it has also resulted in unusual hybrids, such as musical horror-comedy (The Rocky Horror Picture Show), hyperbolic parody (Flesh for Frankenstein), and science fiction (the Alien and Terminator series). This sourcebook provides a complete guide to all of the story's filmic incarnations-including essential information such as cast, creative personnel, and plot summaries-and also guides the reader to relevant primary texts such as scripts, posters, production histories, and newspaper clippings.

    "title": "The Musical Language of Rock",
    "author": "David Temperley",
    "description": "In all of the books about rock music, relatively few focus on the purely musical dimensions of the style: dimensions of harmony and melody, tonality and scale, rhythm and meter, phrase structure and form, and emotional expression. The Musical Language of Rock puts forth a new, comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of rock music by addressing each of these aspects. Eastman music theorist and cognition researcher David Temperley brings together a conventional music-analytic approach with statistical corpus analysis to offer an innovative and insightful approach to the genre. With examples from across a broadly defined rock idiom encompassing everything from the Beatles to Deep Purple, Michael Jackson to Bonnie Raitt, The Musical Language of Rock shows how rock musicians exploit musical parameters to achieve aesthetic and expressive goals-for example, the manipulation of expectation and surprise, the communication of such oppositions as continuity/closure and tension/relaxation, and the expression of emotional states. A major innovation of the book is a three-dimensional model of musical expression-representing valence, energy, and tension-which proves to be a powerful tool for characterizing songs and also for tracing expressive shifts within them. The book includes many musical examples, with sound clips available on the book's website. The Musical Language of Rock presents new insights on the powerful musical mechanisms which have made rock a hallmark of our contemporary musical landscape.",

    "title": "The Correspondence of Catharine Macaulay",
    "author": "Karen Green",
    "description": "Catharine Macaulay was a celebrated republican historian, whose account of the reasons for the seventeenth-century English Revolution, the parliamentary period, and its aftermath was widely read by the mothers and fathers of American Independence and by central players in the French Revolution. As well as publishing her eight volume history, spanning the period from the accession of James I to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, she wrote political pamphlets, offered a sketch of a republican constitution for Corsica, advocated parliamentary reform, and published a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France. Her Letters on Education of 1790 made a decisive impact on the thought of Mary Wollstonecraft, and her Treatise on the Immutability of Moral Truth opposed the skeptical and utilitarian attitudes being developed by Hume and others. This volume brings together for the first time all the available letters between her and her wide-ranging correspondents, who include George Washington, John Adams, Abigail Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, James Otis, Benjamin Rush, David Hume, James Boswell, Thomas Hollis, John Wilkes, Horace Walpole, Mary Wollstonecraft, Jacques-Pierre Brissot de Warville, and many other luminaries of the eighteenth-century enlightenment. It includes an extended introduction to her life and works and offers a unique insight into the thinking of her friends and correspondents during the period between 1760 and 1790, the crucible for the development of modern representative democracies. The Correspondence of Catharine Macaulay will appeal to scholars of philosophy, political thought, women's studies, and eighteenth-century history, as well as those interested in the development of democratic ideas.",

    "title": "The House of the Seven Gables",
    "author": "Nathaniel Hawthorne",
    "description": "In a sleepy little New England village stands a dark, weather-beaten, many-gabled house. This brooding mansion is haunted by a centuries-old curse that casts the shadow of ancestral sin upon the last four members of the distinctive Pyncheon family. Mysterious deaths threaten the living. Musty documents nestle behind hidden panels carrying the secret of the family's salvation-or its downfall. Hawthorne called The House of the Seven Gables \"a Romance,\" and freely bestowed upon it many fascinating gothic touches. A brilliant intertwining of the popular, the symbolic, and the historical, the novel is a powerful exploration of personal and national guilt, a work that Henry James declared \"the closest approach we are likely to have to the Great American Novel.\" Nathaniel Hawthorne was born on July 4, 1804, in Salem, Massachusetts, where his birthplace is now a museum. William Hathorne, who emigrated from England in 1630, was the first of Hawthorne's ancestors to arrive in the colonies. After arriving, William persecuted Quakers. William's son John Hathorne was one of the judges who oversaw the Salem Witch Trials. (One theory is that having learned about this, the author added the \"w\" to his surname in his early twenties, shortly after graduating from college.) Hawthorne's father, Nathaniel Hathorne, Sr., was a sea captain who died in 1808 of yellow fever, when Hawthorne was only four years old, in Raymond, Maine.",

    "title": "Reforming the Presidential Nominating Process",
    "author": "Lisa K. Parshall",
    "description": "The 2020 presidential selection process is already underway. As the political parties finalize their nominating rules and the states jostle for an advantageous contest date, potential challengers are being identified and sized up by party insiders. Once again, media and popular attention will be disproportionately focused on the candidates’ performance in the first and earliest of the state nominating contests—and on how quickly the sequence of primaries and caucuses winnows the field and identifies the presumptive nominees. But what are the implications of a sequential and front-loaded nominating calendar that gives some voters outsized influence while leaving many others with a constrained choice—or no choice—in the selection of their party’s presidential nominee? Reforming the Presidential Nominating Process: Front-Loading's Consequences and the National Primary Solution critiques the contemporary nominating process from the perspective of voters and their right to effectively participate in their parties’ selection of a presidential nominee. Employing both a common-sense and legal, rights-based framework to invite a constitutionally grounded conversation on the legitimacy of the current presidential nominating process, Lisa K. Parshall argues that timing of participation in the nomination goes hand-in-hand with the right to choose a candidate and the fairest way to restore the promise of meaningful and timely participation for all voters is by adopting a same-day national primary. Viewed from the party membership perspective, this work illuminates the fundamental interests at stake that should be considered in any potential reform of the presidential nominating system.",

    "title": "Elijah the Prophet (Classic Reprint)",
    "author": "William M. Taylor",
    "description": "Excerpt from Elijah the Prophet Now, these two deities, Baal, the male, and Ashtaroth, the female, represented the fertilizing and productive principle in nature, and their worship was that of power. To the more cultivated and refined, it was simply a species of Pan theism; to the multitude, it was what one has called the worship of deified abundance, under a splendid and sensu ous ceremonial or, as Maurice has put it, The worship of Baal was the worship of power as distinguished from right eousness.t Hence, the apostasy of Ahab in giving up the personal Jehovah, the covenant God of Israel, and the cre ator and preserver of all things, and preferring Baal, was analogous to, if not, indeed, precisely identical with, the mod ern heresy of those who discard a personal God, and refuse to believe in him who is a loving father, while they deify nat ure under the name of law. Thus this old history has a special appropriateness to the present time, and we may prof itably ponder for a little the record of the manner in which the efforts of Ahab were counteracted and neutralized. The introduction of Baal-worship into Israel was part of a deliberate plan on the part of Ahab. He wished to strength en himself to the fullest extent against his Syrian enemies, while, at the same time, he developed the material resources of his country by an alliance with the Zidonians, who held the sea-board. If he could only succeed in welding Israel and Zidon together, he felt that he could defy the dynasty of Damascus, and look forward to a time of great prosperity from a participation in the unrivaled commerce of the Phoe nicians. But there is no unifying in uence so strong as that of religion. Hence he determined to carry the nation over bodily into the Zidonian worship; and, as the first step in that direction, he allied himself to the royal house of Zidon.

    "author": "Robert E. Howard",
    "description": "This early work by Robert E. Howard was originally published in the 20th century and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. 'The Lost Valley of Iskander' is a story in the El Borak series where El Borak discovers the Greek descendants of Alexander the Great. Robert Ervin Howard was born in Peaster, Texas in 1906. During his youth, his family moved between a variety of Texan boomtowns, and Howard - a bookish and somewhat introverted child - was steeped in the violent myths and legends of the Old South. At fifteen Howard began to read the pulp magazines of the day, and to write more seriously. The December 1922 issue of his high school newspaper featured two of his stories, 'Golden Hope Christmas' and 'West is West'. In 1924 he sold his first piece - a short caveman tale titled 'Spear and Fang' - for $16 to the not-yet-famous Weird Tales magazine. Howard's most famous character, Conan the Cimmerian, was a barbarian-turned-King during the Hyborian Age, a mythical period of some 12,000 years ago. Conan featured in seventeen Weird Tales stories between 1933 and 1936 which is why Howard is now regarded as having spawned the 'sword and sorcery' genre. The Conan stories have since been adapted many times, most famously in the series of films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

From time to time he paused, with a hand to his ear, as if listening. Satisfied that the alley was deserted save for his own presence, he would proceed, hugging the walls. The cobbles were icy, and scarce a moment passed in which he did not have to struggle to maintain his balance. The door of a low tavern opened suddenly, sending a golden shaft of light across the glistening pavement and casting a brilliant patch on the opposite wall. With the light came sounds of laughter and quarreling and ringing glasses. The man laid his hand on his sword, swore softly, and stepped back out of the blinding glare. The flash of light revealed a mask which left visible only the lower half of his face. Men wearing masks were frequently subjected to embarrassing questions; and this man was determined that no one should question him to-night. He waited, hiding in the shadow.",

Fate alone saw the meaning of the web it wove, the mightof it, and its place in the making of a world's history. Men thought but little of either web orweaving, calling them by other names and lighter ones, for the time unconscious of the strength ofthe thread thrown across thousands of miles of leaping, heaving, grey or blue ocean.Fate and Life planned the weaving, and it seemed mere circumstance which guided the Shuttle toand fro between two worlds divided by a gulf broader and deeper than the thousands of miles ofsalt, fierce sea-the gulf of a bitter quarrel deepened by hatred and the shedding of brothers' blood.Between the two worlds of East and West there was no will to draw nearer. Each held apart. Thosewho had rebelled against that which their souls called tyranny, having struggled madly and shedblood in tearing themselves free, turned stern backs upon their unconquered enemies, broke allcords that bound them to the past, flinging off ties of name, kinship and rank, beginning with fiercedisdain a new life.Those who, being rebelled against, found the rebels too passionate in their determination and toodesperate in their defence of their strongholds to be less than unconquerable, sailed back haughtilyto the world which seemed so far the greater power. Plunging into new battles, they added newconquests and splendour to their land, looking back with something of contempt to the half-savageWest left to build its own civilisation without other aid than the strength of its own strong righthand and strong uncultured brain.But while the two worlds held apart, the Shuttle, weaving slowly in the great hand of Fate, drewthem closer and held them firm, each of them all unknowing for many a year, that what had at firstbeen mere threads of gossamer, was forming a web whose strength in time none could compute, whose severance could be accomplished but by tragedy and convulsion",

    "description": "This two-volume collection assembles all the known tales of the fays published by Marie-Catherine Le Jumel de Barneville, Baronne d'Aulnoy (1651-1705). From the early 1690s onwards, Madame d'Aulnoy was an active member of a literary salon where she and the Comtesse de Murat became the most prolific contributors to the new genre of the contes de fees, which they helped invent, shape and develop. Like almost all of the other members of her coterie, she became a renegade female aristocrat writing tales for the select consumption of other renegade female aristocrats about a world the corrupt glamour of which they understood only too well, with a depth of sarcasm that the innocent could not be expected to comprehend. One should regard Madame d'Aulnoy and the Comtesse de Murat as significant writers of Decadent fantasy, and one wonders what they might have done had they been allowed to continue with their work. Given that both had extraordinary imaginative range, it is hard to imagine that they would have run out of inspiration, had they not been violently stopped in their tracks. We have to be grateful that they contrived to publish as much as they did during their brief window of opportunity, leaving behind fugitive material that could be recovered once the worst of the repression had blown over. Considered separately Madame d'Aulnoy and the Comtesse de Murat were great writers of imaginative fiction, but as a competitive collective, they are unique in literary history, and it is as part of that collective endeavor that Madame d'Aulnoy is fully entitled to her classic status today.",

It is sustained by celebrations of the condolence ceremony when participants mourn a dead chief and install his successor for life on good behavior.

THE character of Mr. Addison and bis writings, for justness of thought, strength of reasoning, and purity of style, is too well establilhed to need a recommendation; but their greatest ornament, and that which gives a lustre to all the rest, is his appearing, throughout, a zealous advocate for virtue and religion, against profanenefs and infidelity. And because his excellent discourses upon those subjects lie dispersed among his other writings, and are by that means not so generally known and read as they deserve, it was judged to be no unseasonable service to religion at this time, to move the Bookseller to publish them together in a distinct volume; in hopes, that the politeness and beauty peculiar to Mr. AddiSon's writings would make their way to persons of a superior character and a more liberal education; and, that as they come from the hands of a layman, they may be the more readily received and considered by young gentlemen, as a proper manual of religion.

Against the bloody backdrop of the struggle between Christianity and Islam, The Song of Roland remains a vivid portrayal of medieval life, knightly adventure, and feudal politics. The first great literary works of a culture are its epic chronicles, those that create simple hero-figures about whom the imagination of a nation can crystallize, observed V. S. Pritchett.

The Archaeology of Anxiety is the first extended analysis of why the Silver Age occupies such prominence in Russian collective consciousness. Galina Rylkova examines the Silver Age as a cultural construct-the byproduct of an anxiety that permeated society in reaction to the social, political, and cultural upheavals brought on by the Bolshevik Revolution, the fall of the Romanovs, the Civil War, and Stalin's Great Terror. Rylkova's astute analysis of writings by Anna Akhmatova, Vladimir Nabokov, Boris Pasternak and Victor Erofeev reveals how the construct of the Silver Age was perpetuated and ingrained. Rylkova explores not only the Silver Age's importance to Russia's cultural identity but also the sustainability of this phenomenon. In so doing, she positions the Silver Age as an essential element to Russian cultural survival.",

This bundle offers books one and two in one convenient file, with over 150,000 words of reading. In A VILLA IN SICILY: OLIVE OIL AND MURDER (Book #1), Audrey Smart, 34, is a brilliant vet—yet fed up by her demanding clients who think they know more than her and who don’t care about their animals. Burnt-out with the endless hours, she wonders if the time has come for a new direction. And when her 15th year high school reunion (and her hopes for re-sparking on old flame) end in disaster, Audrey knows the time has come to make a change. When Audrey sees an ad for a $1 home in Sicily, it captivates her. The only catch is that the house requires renovation, something she knows little about. She wonders if it could be real—and if she may really be crazy enough to go for it. Can Audrey create a life and career—and the home of her dreams—in a beautiful Sicilian village? And perhaps even find love while she’s there? Or will an unexpected death—one that only she can solve—put an end to all of her plans? Are some dreams too good to be true? In A VILLA IN SICILY: FIGS AND A CADAVER (Book #2), Audrey is busy working to open the town’s new shelter, while also renovating her own problematic home—and dating again. With the help of friends, she begins taking in sick strays. But not everyone in town is grateful for her services, and she soon makes unexpected enemies. When Audrey gets a tip about an injured dog near the coast and goes to find him—she finds the dead body of a powerful local instead. Can Audrey, now a suspect, solve the crime and clear her name? Or will her Sicilian dream fall apart? A laugh-out-loud cozy packed with mystery, intrigue, renovation, animals, food, wine—and of course, love—THE CATS AND DOGS COZY MYSTERY SERIES will capture your heart and keep you glued to the very last page.

    "description": "Contrary to the apocalyptic pronouncements of paper media's imminent demise in the digital age, there has been a veritable surge of creative reimaginings of books as bearers of the literary. From typographic experiments (Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, Steven Hall's The Raw Shark Texts) to accordion books (Anne Carson's Nox), from cut ups (Jonathan Safran Foer's Tree of Codes) to collages (Graham Rawle's Woman's World), from erasures (Mary Ruefle's A Little White Shadow) to mixups (Simon Morris's The Interpretations of Dreams), print literature has gone through anything but a slow, inevitable death. In fact, it has re-invented itself materially. Starting from this idea of media plurality, Book Presence in a Digital Age explores the resilience of print literatures, book art, and zines in the late age of print from a contemporary perspective, while incorporating longer-term views on media archeology and media change. Even as it focuses on the materiality of books and literary writing in the present, Book Presence also takes into consideration earlier 20th-century \"moments\" of media transition, developing the concepts of presence and materiality as analytical tools to perform literary criticism in a digital age. Bringing together leading scholars, artists, and publishers, Book Presence in a Digital Age offers a variety of perspectives on the past, present, and future of the book as medium, the complex relationship of materiality to virtuality, and of the analog to the digital.",

We just have to let it run its course and pray that the zombies rot out soon. I’m not Rambo, Supergirl, or Xena, but I can’t let worry consume me either. Just because I’m not made out of titanium, that doesn’t mean I won’t make it to the finish line. I’ve gotta stay brave and keep fighting as hard as I can and never, ever give up hope. — Val Bennett – zombie fighter & survivor I have to keep my footing, catch my breath, and keep walking the twisting path ahead. There are many huge hurdles to face. I don’t know what life holds for me, but I will survive as long as I can, and I won’t go down without a fight. — Sammy Evans – survivor & zombie fighter Humans are a rare and endangered species. Swallowing down our fear, we must fight to protect humanity at all costs. Protecting the human race must be our number one priority. We need to fight for the future we want, not the one that’s been delivered to us. Taking back our world is a fight I will never give up on. And in my opinion, that makes every zombie hunter a very special breed of warrior. — Dean Walters - survivor & zombie hunter",

    "description": "“An action packed fantasy sure to please fans of Morgan Rice’s previous novels, along with fans of works such as The Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini…. Fans of Young Adult Fiction will devour this latest work by Rice and beg for more.” --The Wanderer, A Literary Journal (regarding Rise of the Dragons) A bundle of books #4 (A FORGE OF VALOR) and #5 (A REALM OF SHADOWS) in Morgan Rice’s #1 Bestselling fantasy series KINGS AND SORCERERS, comprising 6 books. The series begins with RISE OF THE DRAGONS (Book #1), a free download on Amazon with over 500 five star reviews! In A FORGE OF VALOR, Kyra slowly returns from the verge of death, healed by Kyle’s love and mysterious power. As he sacrifices for her, she regains her strength—yet not without a price. She presses Alva for the secret of her lineage, and he finally reveals all about her mother. Aidan, Motley at his side, strives to rescue his father, trapped in the perilous capital, while in the far corner of the kingdom, Merk, amazed by what he discovers in the Tower of Ur, braces himself against a massive troll invasion. Dierdre finds herself facing a full-fledged Pandesian invasion in her embattled city of Ur. In A REALM OF SHADOWS, Kyra finds herself in the midst of a burning capital, attacked by a host of dragons, clinging for life. With her beloved homeland destroyed, The Flames down and the trolls pouring in, Kyra must urgently quest to Marda to retrieve the magic weapon before it is too late—even if it takes her into the very heart of darkness. Duncan finds himself trapped, with the others, in the burning capital, and he uses all his wits to find his men, attempt escape, and rally his forces to regroup and attack Pandesia. Across the kingdom, Merk sails with King Tarnis’ daughter through the Bay of Death as they abandon the Tower of Kos and sail for the warrior isle of Knossos. With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, KINGS AND SORCERERS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons. It is fantasy at its finest, inviting us into a world that will live with us forever, one that appeals to all ages and genders.",

    "description": "Tougher than the Rest – Book One MacLarens of Fire Mountain Historical Western Romance Series “A passionate, fast-paced story set in the untamed western frontier by an exciting new voice in historical romance.” Niall MacLaren is the oldest of four brothers, and the undisputed leader of the family. A widower, and single father, his focus is on building the MacLaren ranch into the largest and most successful in northern Arizona. He is serious about two things—his responsibility to the family and his future marriage to the wealthy, well-connected widow who will secure his place in the territory’s destiny. Katherine is determined to live the life she’s dreamed about. With a job waiting for her in the growing town of Los Angeles, California, the young teacher from Philadelphia begins a journey across the United States with only a couple of trunks and her spinster companion. Life is perfect for this adventurous, beautiful young woman, until an accident throws her into the arms of the one man who can destroy it all. Fighting his growing attraction and strong desire for the beautiful stranger, Niall is more determined than ever to push emotions aside to focus on his goals of wealth and political gain. But looking into the clear, blue eyes of the woman who could ruin everything, Niall discovers he will have to harden his heart and be tougher than he’s ever been in his life…Tougher than the Rest. Faster than the Rest – Book Two MacLarens of Fire Mountain Historical Western Romance Series “Headstrong, brash, confident, and complex, the MacLarens of Fire Mountain will captivate you with strong characters set in the wild and rugged western frontier.” Handsome, ruthless, young U.S. Marshal Jamie MacLaren had lost everything—his parents, his family connections, and his childhood sweetheart—but now he’s back in Fire Mountain and ready for another chance. Just as he successfully reconnects with his family and starts to rebuild his life, he gets the unexpected and unwanted assignment of rescuing the woman who broke his heart. Beautiful, wealthy Victoria Wicklin chose money and power over love, but is now fighting for her life—or is she? Who has she become in the seven years since she left Fire Mountain to take up her life in San Francisco? Is she really as innocent as she says? Marshal MacLaren struggles to learn the truth and do his job, but the past and present lead him in different directions as his heart and brain wage battle. Is Victoria a victim or a villain? Is life offering him another chance, or just another heartbreak? As Jamie and Victoria struggle to uncover past secrets and come to grips with their shared passion, another danger arises. A life-altering danger that is out of their control and threatens to destroy any chance for a shared future. Harder than the Rest – Book Three MacLarens of Fire Mountain Historical Western Romance Series “They are men you want on your side. Hard, confident, and loyal, the MacLarens of Fire Mountain will seize your attention from the first page.” Will MacLaren is a hardened, plain-speaking bounty hunter. His life centers on finding men guilty of horrendous crimes and making sure justice is done. There is no place in his world for the carefree attitude he carried years before when a tragic event destroyed his dreams. Amanda is the daughter of a successful Colorado rancher. Determined and proud, she works hard to prove she is as capable as any man and worthy to be her father’s heir. When a stranger arrives, her independent nature collides with the strong pull toward the handsome ranch hand. But is he what he seems and could his secrets endanger her as well as her family? The last thing Will needs is to feel passion for another woman. But Amanda elicits feelings he thought were long buried. Can Will’s desire for her change him? Or will the vengeance he seeks against the one man he wants to destroy—a dangerous opponent without a conscious—continue to control his life?

    "title": "Innovation in Byzantine Medicine",
    "author": "Petros Bouras-Vallianatos",
    "description": "Byzantine medicine remains a little known and misrepresented field not only in the context of debates on medieval medicine, but also among Byzantinists themselves. It is often viewed as 'stagnant' and mainly preserving ancient ideas, and our knowledge of it continues to be based to a great extent on the comments of earlier authorities, which are often repeated uncritically. This volume presents the first comprehensive examination of the medical corpus of, arguably, the most important Late Byzantine physician: John Zacharias Aktouarios (c.1275-c.1330). Its main thesis is that John's medical works show an astonishing degree of openness to knowledge from outside Byzantium combined with a significant degree of originality, in particular, in the fields of uroscopy and human physiology. The analysis of John's edited (On Urines and On Psychic Pneuma) and unedited (Medical Epitome) treatises is supported for the first time by the consultation of a large number of manuscripts, and is also informed by evidence from a wide range of medical sources, including those previously unpublished, and texts from other genres, such as epistolography and merchants' accounts. The contextualization of John's corpus sheds new light on the development of Byzantine medical thought and practice, and enhances our understanding of the Late Byzantine social and intellectual landscape. Through examination of his medical observations in the light of examples from the medieval Latin and Islamic worlds, his theories are also placed within the wider Mediterranean milieu, highlighting the cultural exchange between Byzantium and its neighbours.",

    "author": "Lisa Renaud",
    "description": "Find out what it's like to be the middle child and what it means to be able to stand out and feel special. Students gain a deeper understanding of their own mind to visualize what makes them unique. Sort words from the story as short a or long a vowels. Complete quotes from the story with their missing quotation marks. Recognize whether Freddy practiced for his part before or after he showed how well he could jump. Students draw their own interpretation of Freddy's costume for the play, and explain how it fits and some of its important details. Brainstorm things that would make a good play and things that would make a bad play. Students compare themselves to Freddy in a Venn Diagram graphic organizer. Aligned to your State Standards and written to Bloom's Taxonomy, additional crossword, word search, comprehension quiz and answer key are also included. About the Novel: Freddy Dissel feels trapped between an older brother and younger sister. As the middle child, he feels neglected by everyone around him. He lost his room to his younger sister, and now shares with his older brother. He doesn't get new clothes of his own, but instead wears his brother's hand-me-downs. He is too young to play with his older brother, but too old to play with his younger sister. One day, Freddy learns of a school play and decides to try out for it. The only problem being, it's only for the fifth and sixth graders. But that doesn't stop Freddy. He lands a special part as the green kangaroo. Now Freddy can shine out front, no longer stuck in the middle.",

    "description": "Foreword by Colby Sharp In the decade since the first edition of Still Learning to Read was published, the prevalence of testing and the Common Core State Standards have changed what is expected of both teachers and students. The new edition of Still Learning to Read focuses on the needs of students in grades 3-6 in all aspects of reading workshop, including reading workshop, read-aloud, classroom design, digital tools, fiction, nonfiction, and close reading. The book stays true to its original beliefs of slowing down and knowing our readers, but it also takes into account the sense of urgency that changing times and standards impose on classrooms. This edition examines current trends in literacy, includes a new section on intentional instructional planning, and provides expanded examples of mini-lessons and routines that promote deeper thinking about learning. It also includes a brand new chapter on scaffolding for reading nonfiction and showcases the authors' latest thinking on close reading and text complexity. Online videos provide glimpses into classrooms as students make book choices, work in small groups, and discuss their reading notebooks. Expanded and updated book lists, recommendations for digital tools, lesson cycles, and sections specifically written for school leaders round out this foundational resource.",

    "title": "After Forever",
    "author": "Julie Johnstone",
    "description": "A rogue hires a lady to turn him into a gentleman, but he finds he cannot resist giving her lessons on love and desire. A year and a half after her husband’s tragic death, all Lady Julianna Barrows wants is to be left alone and forget that most of her heart went with him when he passed. Instead, she finds herself the subject of many a matchmaking scheme and lurid offer to ease her widowhood, as well as save her fading fortune. Desperate to avoid an arranged marriage, she takes on a position as a tutor, only to discover that the man she’s helping unexpectedly stirs her heart and passion. Nash Wolverton boxed his way out of the London slums and into immense wealth, but he couldn’t care less about Society’s approval. Except he has his by-blow daughter’s future to consider. To ensure her acceptance into Society, he’ll endure anything―including procuring a tutor to transform him into a gentleman so he can secure a suitable, boring wife. Yet what he wants changes the moment he hires the widow Julianna. She may be a lady, but she’s far from tedious. Bold and compassionate, she is nothing like the women of the ton. Suddenly, she’s elicited a simmering desire in him, and even a longing to love and be loved that he always thought out of his reach. Knowing what he planned to settle for can now never be enough, he vows to win her love. But as the walls she’s built begin to crumble and a second chance for Julianna seems possible, her fears threaten to destroy all and she alone must decide if protecting her heart trumps breaking Nash’s. The Whisper of Scandal series includes: Bargaining with a Rake Conspiring with a Rogue Dancing with a Devil After Forever The Dangerous Duke of Dinnisfree",

    "description": "Eight years ago, Lord Colin Thorne rescued a young woman from a convent at the direction of the Home Office – a woman who was destined to become his partner in the art of spycraft. Now, after unexpectedly inheriting his brother’s title, Colin is expected to give up his life’s work with Thera and settle down, which includes announcing his engagement to a woman he barely knows on Christmas Eve. For the last six years, Teresa Barrington has done her duty to Crown and country by Colin’s side and never regretted a moment of it, even when doing so cost her more than she should have been willing to give. Now it’s time for Colin to begin a new life, but this time without her by his side. She, in turn, is about to embark upon a new life as well, when she is introduced to Society as the long-lost granddaughter of a duke. However, parting ways is something that both Colin and Thera are finding easier said than done. Can they both somehow make peace with their proposed new futures, or will they give in to temptation and the magic of the holiday season as it winds its way around them at a Christmastide house party that is legendary for producing love matches? This 42,300-word novella, which is a companion piece to the \"Tales From Seldon Park\" series, is written in the modern, Regency romance style for a slightly hotter and sexier read. It may not be appropriate for younger audiences.",

    "description": "Keeping abreast of the major strides made in the field of neuropathology, Essentials of Diagnostic Surgical Neuropathology brings out its second edition with the aim of keeping the neuroscience community updated with the new developments in neuropathology. This second edition comes close on the heels of the fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumours (WHO CNS5) which was published in 2021. This new edition has retained the concise, point wise format of the earlier edition, making it a handy reference book. While the major changes in this edition are in neoplastic pathology, this book also provides updates in the pathology of non-neoplastic lesions that need surgical intervention. The highlights of the neoplastic section are: Description of new tumour types and subtypes included in the WHO CNS5 Grading of tumours as per WHO CNS5 Relevant immune profile and diagnostic molecular pathology for each tumour according to WHO CNS5. Essential and desirable diagnostic criteria, as defined by WHO CNS5, in a tabular form at the end The salient features of the non-neoplastic section include: New section on Therapy-related Neuropathology Recent classifications of vascular malformations and epilepsy related lesions New section on Infectious and Inflammatory Lesions Mimicking Neoplasms New chapter on Surgical Pathology of Spinal Dysraphism and Other Neural Tube Defects Another important feature includes the addition of a new chapter on techniques viz. Smears in the Rapid Diagnosis of Central Nervous System Lesions Challenges in the Interpretation of Stereotactic Biopsies",

    "title": "Structural Fat Grafting",
    "author": "Sydney Coleman",
    "description": "Fat grafting is rapidly becoming one of the most requested procedures for a new generation. It offers a valuable tool to address patient demands for less invasive cosmetic procedures that produce natural, long-lasting results. Structural Fat Grafting, written by Dr. Sydney Coleman, who helped pioneer this technique, is the first comprehensive work on this topic. It provides surgeons with the expert guidance needed to master this technique for a wide variety of applications, including facial and hand rejuvenation, adjustment of facial proportions, and correction of liposuction deformities. This remarkable book presents a revolutionary new model for analyzing facial aging that is destined to dramatically alter the way you analyze and treat patients. Each clinical chapter is a monograph unto itself, filled with case presentations, tips and tricks, and sound advice to guide the surgeon through the key maneuvers necessary for fat grafting in each anatomic area. Learn Exciting, New Ways to Approach Classic Problems Beautifully illustrated with step-by-step photographs and illustrations, it provides a complete blueprint for achieving positive, repeatable outcomes from a procedure that offers an alternative to operations that elevate and tighten. Numerous preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative views are included to demonstrate the efficacy of structural fat grafting and the excellent long-term results that can be expected. Dr. Coleman's technique for preparation, harvest, refinement, and placement of fat is carefully detailed to help you achieve long-lasting, stable results. Information about incisions, levels of infiltration, volume ranges, technical considerations, key strategies, most likely technical mistakes, and possible complications are included in each chapter to provide the reader with the guidance for performing this technique for a variety of clinical applications. The accompanying CD features operative video demonstrating fat grafting techniques in various anatomic areas. Readers will find this exciting volume invaluable as they discover the full arsenal of skills required to master this increasingly popular procedure.",

    "title": "The Moral of the Story",
    "author": "John H. Lockwood",
    "description": "The problem this project attempts to solve is to develop a workable moral education in light of the clash between religious forms of moral education and U.S. Supreme Court decisions concerning them. The concept of story and storytelling has been suggested as a unifying focus for disparate prescriptions for moral education. Several recent approaches to moral storytelling have been proposed. The approaches of William Bennett, Nel Noddings, and Herbert Kohl are among those which have attempted to combine moral education and storytelling within the last decade. Bennett is identified with other theorists whose primary concern is the moral content of a story. Noddings is identified as a process theorist, whose primary concern is the process of moral storytelling, not the content. Kohl is identified as a reflection theorist, whose approach challenges tradition in the hope of creating a more moral society. Each one of these three approaches attempts to provide a comprehensive program of moral education, but they fall short of that goal. The purpose of this project, then, is to construct a storytelling moral education program that improves upon earlier approaches. Using the three levels of moral thinking posited by R.M. Hare, a three-level approach to moral storytelling is proposed. The intuitive, critical, and meta-ethical levels of moral thinking that Hare refers to are used to frame a new, three-level, approach to moral storytelling. The three-level approach combines content, process, and reflection into a unified prescription for moral education. Thus, a more comprehensive plan for moral education through storytelling is developed, one that respects traditional forms of moral education while remaining within the parameters set by the U.S. Supreme Court.",

A leader’s role is to create engagement and belief so that people will act. And there’s no more powerful way to grab attention, be remembered, and engage action than by telling stories—about who you are, what you do, and why you do it. Today, “storytelling” is a hot topic in organizations… but most leaders still struggle to act upon it. How do we find and tell our stories quickly, in an environment of urgency where we can hardly pause to catch our breath? For more than a decade Hutchens has tested his method of rapid and strategic story development with innovation teams in Silicon Valley, across global Fortune 100 leadership teams, and more. Hutchens has honed a unique process that is active, potent, and strategically focused . . . and also a lot of fun. In Story Dash, Hutchens shares a repeatable process to find, develop, and deploy your “narrative assets”—that is, your urgent core stories that hold value. Even better, he will help you do it FAST; often in less than a day. Story Dash will help you to: Access your natural capacity for storytelling Find your stories—and figure out which ones to tell Build your narrative so it lands with unforgettable impact Find your own voice of authentic leadership Bring more of who you are to your teams and your markets Fully illustrated and written in a clear, sharp voice, Story Dash shares the fastest way to find lots of stories that will create action around the work you care about most.",

    "title": "True Story",
    "author": "Ty Montague",
    "description": "Is your company a storyteller--or a storydoer? The old way to market a business was storytelling. But in today's world, simply communicating your brand's story in the hope that customers will listen is no longer enough. Instead, your authentic brand must be evident in every action the organization undertakes. Today's most successful businesses are storydoers. These companies create products and services that, from the very beginning, are manifestations of an authentic and meaningful story--one told primarily through action, not advertising. In True Story, creative executive Ty Montague argues that any business, regardless of size or industry, can embrace the principles of storydoing. Indeed, our best-run companies--from small start-ups to global conglomerates--organize around a coherent narrative that is then broadcast through every action they take (from product design to customer service to marketing). Montague shows why storydoing firms are nimble, more adaptive to change, and more efficiently run businesses. Montague is a founder of the growth consultancy co:collective and the former president and CCO of J. Walter Thompson, the largest advertising agency in North America. He brings his depth of creative business experience to the book and provides a clear framework and proven process for bringing you and your customers together in the creation of your brand story. Montague introduces five critical elements--what he calls the \"the four truths and the action map\"--that are the foundation of storydoing: * the participants (your customers, partners, and employees) * the protagonist (your company today) * the stage (the world around your business) * the quest (your driving ambition and contribution to the world) * your action map (the actions that will make your story real for participants) The book is filled with examples of how forward-thinking organizations--including Red Bull, Shaklee, Grind, TOMS Shoes, and News Corporation--are effectively using storydoing to transform their organizations and drive extraordinary results.",

    "title": "Indian Short Story: A Critical Evaluation",
    "author": "Dipak Giri",
    "description": "As a literary genre, Indian short story, next to poetry, is the most popular and accepted form of literature for its variety and nuance of Indian experience. Evolving over time, it has gained wide currency among people. Even after its recourse to traditional rules of the craft, Indian short story amazingly presents itself an original and distinctive form of art. Developed out of contemporary native literature and western storytelling technique, Indian short story presents an amalgation of two different literary traditions which has become unique and distinctive in course of time and long been catering to the taste of people. Ever since its origin, it has already witnessed a plethora of Indian writers who have made significant contributions to this genre by encapsulating the essence of Indian life and culture. They are Rabindranath Tagore, Munshi Premchand, R.K. Narayan, Mulk Raj Anand, Ismat Chughtai, Ruskin Bond, Khushwant Singh, Saadat Hasan Manto, Ashapurna Devi, Jhumpa Lahiri, Anita Desai, Kiran Desai, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Anita Nair, Qurratulain Hyder, Namita Gokhale, Madhulika Liddle , just to name a few. At present Indian short story has taken a wider form, much more than earlier and almost every writer has started trying her or his hand at this field that it is too difficult for one to sum up the whole in one singular work. Still this present book is an endeavour to compile the works of major Indian short story writers in a short but comprehensive way in order to supply the best possible materials to readers, writers, academics, scholars and students who wish to do further studies in this field. There are twenty six chapters in this book which together presents a rich tapestry of this genre. Hopefully this book will march towards many unexplored realms exciting many curious minds, restarting many fruitful dialogues and invigorating many fresh and new ideas among academics, scholars and students alike.",

Lisa Cron shares the art of practical empathy with leaders who care enough to make a difference.”—Seth Godin, author of The Practice A step-by-step guide to using the brain’s hardwired need for story to achieve any goal, from the author of Wired for Story Whether you’re pitching a product, saving the planet, or convincing your kids not to text and drive, story isn’t just one way to persuade. It’s the way. It’s built into the architecture of the brain, and has been since early humans gathered around the camp fire, trying to figure out how to outsmart the lion next door. In Story or Die, story coach Lisa Cron sets out to decode the power of story, first by examining how the brain processes information, translates it into narrative, and then guards it as if your life depends on it. Armed with that insight, she focuses on how to find your real target audience and then pinpoint their hidden resistance. Finally, she takes you, step-by-step, through the creation of your own story, one that allows your audience to overcome their resistance and take up your call to action, not because you told them to, but because they want to. That is the power of story. Use it wisely.",

The Lower Story, our story, is actually many stories of men and women interacting with God in the daily course of life. The Upper Story is God’s story, the tale of his great, overarching purpose that fits all the individual stories together like panels in one unified mural.” In this new edition, Randy dives deeper in the Upper and Lower stories and shows how both perspectives will open your eyes to the richness and relevance of the Bible. Illuminating God’s master-plan from Genesis to our daily lives, The Heart of the Story will encourage you to experience the joy that comes from aligning your stories with God’s.",

This is not just a book for writers. Each one of us has a story, and understanding God's work in our stories is a vital part of our faith. Through the spiritual practice of writing, we can \"remember\" his acts among us, \"declare his glory among the nations,\" and pass on to others what we have witnessed of God in this life: the mysterious, the tragic, the miraculous, the ordinary. With a companion video curriculum from RightNow Media, this is a \"why not\" book as opposed to a \"how to\" book. Leslie asks each of us an important question: \"Why not learn to tell your story, in the context of the grander story of God?\"",

    "title": "The Story of Switzerland",
    "author": "Lina Hug; Richard Stead",
    "description": "For many reasons, some of which are obvious to the least thoughtful, the history of Switzerland is peculiarly interesting, and not least so to English-speaking peoples. In the first place, the \"playground of Europe\" is every year visited by large numbers of British and Americans, some of whom indeed are familiar with almost every corner of it. Then to the Anglo-Saxon race the grand spectacle of a handful of freemen nobly struggling for and maintaining their freedom, often amidst enormous difficulties, and against appalling odds, cannot but be heart-stirring. To the citizen of the great American republic a study of the constitution of the little European republic should bring both interest and profita constitution resembling in many points that of his own country, and yet in many other respects so different. And few readers, of whatever nationality, can, we think, peruse this story without a feeling of admiration for a gallant people who have fought against oppression as the Swiss have fought, who have loved freedom as they have loved it, and who have performed the well-nigh incredible feats of arms the Switzers have performed. And as Sir Francis O. Adams and Mr. Cunningham well point out in their recently published work on the Swiss Confederation, as a study in constitutional history, the value of the story of the development of the Confederation can hardly be over-estimated. Few of the existing accounts of Swiss history which have appeared in the English language go back beyond the year 1291 a.d., the date of the earliest Swiss League, and of course Switzerland as a nation cannot boast of an earlier origin. But surely some account should be given of the previous history of the men who founded the League. For a country which has been occupied at different periods by lakemen, Helvetians, and Romans; where Alamanni, Burgundians, and Franks have played their parts; where Charlemagne lived and ruled, and Charles the Bold fought; where the great families of the Zaerings, the Kyburgs, and Savoy struggled; and whence the now mighty house of Habsburg sprang (and domineered)all this before 1291a country with such a story to tell of its earlier times, we say, should not have that story left untold. Accordingly in this volume the history of the period before the formation of the Confederation has been dwelt upon at some little length. It should be mentioned, too, that in view of the very general interest caused by the remarkable discovery of the Swiss lake settlements a few years ago, a chapter has been devoted to the subject.",

    "title": "The Monkey Mountain Story",
    "author": "Michael White; Bai Jin De",
    "description": "The Monkey Mountain story started in a Canadian community health centre. Over the past ten years, it has been successfully introduced to groups attending community health and recreational centres and in retirement and nursing homes, in diabetes and mental health programs. Presentations at community college activation programs and at the Toronto Island Sunshine Center have resulted in Monkey Mountain being taken to many settings. Tai Chi has real benefits for all ages. But especially as we get older, we can lose the ability or confidence to walk and move about easily. That loss can be the result of physical changes or simply because of life factors such as our constant use of chairs. Consider falls alone. A serious fall in later years is often the event that may begin the loss of independence. People who do Tai Chi and who do the Monkey Mountain story really do improve their balance and flexibility. They avoid or recover from near falls. They gain or regain their ability to walk or to enjoy exercise. Being able to move about with confidence encourages socialization and adds to the enjoyment of living. There is also a calming logic to the moves of Tai Chi and the Monkey Mountain story. The concentration required to learn and play the moves clears the mind and relieves stress. Tai Chi is sometimes called a moving meditation.",

    "description": "Each of us has come to our current life stance through a journey of unique experiencesbeing born at this time, growing up in this particular social setting and culture, experiencing these specific successes and losses, and having these significant relationships. Whether we are in the early, middle, or latter part of our personal faith story, the ending is still ahead of usand reviewing our own faith story helps us chart our course into the future. Using psychologist Dan McAdamss idea that we make sense of life by composing our own life story, author Bradley Hanson explores how our personal identity and spirituality are influenced by the meaning and values embedded in our childhood family life and major story lines promoted by our culture. In our most basic quest to make sense of life, he considers sharply contrasting answers to five fundamental questions. With reflection and suggested group discussion questions at the end of each chapter, this study explores the idea that spirituality and ones life story are intimately connected. Praise for Spirituality and Your Life Story Real people tell their stories of success, love, friendship, forgiveness, and loss. Brad Hanson helps us ponder our own deepest commitments and the paths we follow to realize them. A fine book for individual reflection or group discussion. H. George Anderson, former presiding bishop, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America",

Specifically, insights from narrative analysis are used to discern in the Book of Psalms a story with a plot that is told by multiple voices - engaged with one another and with God - as they address crucial junctures in Israel's life. These enduring voices offer guidance to congregations of an emerging church in a Post-Christendom era.",

    "title": "Telling the Old Testament Story",
    "author": "Dr. Brad E. Kelle",
    "description": "While honoring the historical context and literary diversity of the Old Testament, Telling the Old Testament Story is a thematic reading that construes the OT as a complex but coherent narrative. Unlike standard, introductory textbooks that only cover basic background and interpretive issues for each Old Testament book, this introduction combines a thematic approach with careful exegetical attention to representative biblical texts, ultimately telling the macro-level story, while drawing out the multiple nuances present within different texts and traditions. The book works from the Protestant canonical arrangement of the Old Testament, which understands the story of the Old Testament as the story of God and God’s relationship with all creation in love and redemption—a story that joins the New Testament to the Old. Within this broader story, the Old Testament presents the specific story of God and God’s relationship with Israel as the people called, created, and formed to be God’s covenant partner and instrument within creation. The Old Testament begins by introducing God’s mission in Genesis. The story opens with the portrait of God’s good, intended creation of right-relationships (Gen 1—2) and the subsequent distortion of that good creation as a result of humanity’s rebellion (Gen 3—11). Genesis 12 and following introduce God’s commitment to restore creation back to the right-relationships and divine intentions with which it began. Coming out of God’s new covenant engagement with creation in Gen 9, this divine purpose begins with the calling of a people (who turn out to be the manifold descendants of Abraham and Sarah) to be God’s instrument of blessing for all creation and thus to reverse the curse brought on by sin. The diverse traditions that comprise the remainder of the Pentateuch then combine to portray the creation and formation of Israel as a people prepared to be God’s instrument of restoration and blessing. As the subsequent Old Testament books portray Israel’s life in the land and journey into and out of exile, the reader encounters complex perspectives on Israel’s attempts to understand who God is, who they are as God’s people, and how, therefore, they ought to live out their identity as God’s people within God’s mission in the world. The final prophetic books that conclude the Protestant Old Testament ultimately give the story of God’s mission and people an open-ended quality, suggesting that God’s mission for God’s people continues and leading Christian readers to consider the New Testament’s story of the Church as an extension and expansion of the broader story of God introduced in the Old Testament. The main methodological perspective that informs the book includes work on the phenomenological function of narrative (especially story’s function to shape the identity and practice of the reader), as well as more recent so-called “missional” approaches to reading Christian scripture. Canonical criticism provides the primary means for relating the distinctive voices within the Old Testament texts that still honor the particularity and diversity of the discrete compositions. Accessibly written, this book invites readers to enter imaginatively into the biblical story and find the Old Testament's lively and enduring implications.",

But halfway through her performance, while the partygoers look on helplessly, masked men drag Tamar off the stage and into a waiting speedboat. Detective Steve Carella is just showing up for the graveyard shift when news of the kidnapping comes in. Working disjointedly with a Joint Task Force that calls itself \"The Squad,\" Carella and the men and women of the Eight-Seven must find Tamar before time -- or indeed her very life -- runs out. In this brilliant look at the music industry, Ed McBain once again combines his mastery of the form with the fast-paced dialogue and intricate plotting that have become his signature.",

    "author": "Bruce M. Jakosky",
    "description": "Are we alone in the universe? As humans, are we unique or are we part of a greater cosmic existence? What is lifeÕs future on Earth and beyond? How does life begin and develop? These are age-old questions that have inspired wonder and controversy ever since the first people looked up into the sky. With todayÕs technology, however, we are closer than ever to finding the answers. Astrobiology is the relatively new, but fast growing scientific discipline that involves trying to understand the origin, evolution, and distribution of life within the universe. It is also one of the few scientific disciplines that attracts the publicÕs intense curiosity and attention. This interest stems largely from the deep personal meaning that the possible existence of extraterrestrial life has for so many. Whether this meaning relates to addressing the ÒBig QuestionsÓ of our existence, the possibility of encountering life on other planets, or the potential impact on our understanding of religion, there is no doubt that the public is firmly vested in finding answers. In this broadly accessible introduction to the field, Bruce Jakosky looks at the search for life in the universe not only from a scientific perspective, but also from a distinctly social one. In lucid and engaging prose, he addresses topics including the contradiction between the publicÕs fascination and the meager dialogue that exists between those within the scientific community and those outside of it, and what has become some of the most impassioned political wrangling ever seen in government science funding.",

Simon comes along and doesn’t expect to find much more excitement in the tiny Scottish town where Argyle’s family lives. Until he meets Beth, Argyle’s older sister. She’s beautiful, brash and clearly interested in him. When her father warns him to stay away from her, Simon tries, but sometimes destiny has a hope of it’s own. Question the Darkness – Book #2 Learn how it all began … before Rae Kerrigan. The sins of the father are the sins of the son.

This ink is going to give him a supernatural ability unlike anyone before him. When secrets of the past begin to reveal themselves, he questions everything he’s ever known. Pressure from Guilder Boarding School and the Privy Council only confuse Simon more as he struggles to find himself. How hard will he have to shake the family tree to find the truth about the past?

    "description": "“Morgan Rice's imagination is limitless. In another series that promises to be as entertaining as the previous ones, A THRONE OF SISTERS presents us with the tale of two sisters (Sophia and Kate), orphans, fighting to survive in a cruel and demanding world of an orphanage. An instant success. I can hardly wait to put my hands on the second and third books!” --Books and Movie Reviews (Roberto Mattos) A bundle of the first three books in Morgan Rice’s new fantasy series A THRONE FOR SISTERS (A THRONE FOR SISTERS, A COURT FOR THIEVES, and A SONG FOR ORPHANS). Here are three bestselling novels, all in one convenient file, which offer a great introduction to the A THRONE FOR SISTERS series. Over 250,000 words of reading, all for an incredible price—it also makes the perfect gift! In A THRONE FOR SISTERS (Book one), Sophia, 17, and her younger sister Kate, 15, are desperate to leave their horrific orphanage. Orphans, unwanted and unloved, they nonetheless dream of coming of age elsewhere, of finding a better life, even if that means living on the streets of the brutal city of Ashton. Sophia and Kate, also best friends, have each other’s backs—and yet they want different things from life. Sophia, a romantic, more elegant, dreams of entering court and finding a noble to fall in love with. Kate, a fighter, dreams of mastering the sword, of battling dragons, and becoming a warrior. They are both united, though, by their secret, paranormal power to read other’s minds, their only saving grace in a world that seems bent to destroy them. In A COURT FOR THIEVES (A Throne for Sisters—Book Two), Sophia, 17, finds her world upside down as she is cast from the romantic world of aristocracy and back to the horrors of the orphanage. This time the nuns seem intent on killing her. Yet that doesn’t pain her as much as her broken heart. Will Sebastian realize his mistake and come back for her? Her younger sister Kate, 15, embarks on her training with the witch, coming of age under her auspices, mastering the sword, gaining more power than she ever imagined possible—and determined to embark on a quest to save her sister. She finds herself immersed in a world of violence and combat, of a magic she craves—and yet one that may consume her. In A SONG FOR ORPHANS (A Throne for Sisters—Book Three), Sophia, 17, journeys in search of her parents. Her quest takes her to foreign and strange lands—and to a shocking secret she could never imagine. Kate, 15, is summoned by the witch, as her time has come to repay the favor. But Kate is changing, coming of age, become ever more powerful—and what will become of Kate if she makes a deal with darkness? Sebastian, a romantic, follows his heart, throwing it all away to reject his family and find Sophia. But Lady D’Angelica is still bent on killing her—and may have other plans. A THRONE FOR SISTER is a dazzling new fantasy series rife with love, heartbreak, tragedy, action, adventure, magic, sorcery, dragons, fate and heart-pounding suspense. A page turner, it is filled with characters that will make you fall in love, and a world you will never forget. Book #4 in A THRONE FOR SISTERS will be released soon!",
